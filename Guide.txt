K-MAX
=====
A set of scripts for analysing and resynthesising pitch contours
using estimated points of maximum curvature in the contour. These are
calculated using the peaks and valleys of the second time derivative of F0.

II. GUIDE
=========
K-Max opens sound files and texgrids in a directory for editing and analysis.
    A. REQUIREMENTS
        1. sound file (.wav)
        2. textgrid with at least an interval tier showing start and end of
           utterance.
        3. all textgrid files must share the same name as the sound file.

    B. OPTIONAL
        1. pitch object (.Pitch) [if does not exist @fixPitch will be called]

    C. MASTER UI MENU
        1. Directory: path to directory contain files to be analysed.
        2. Directory Information: name of sub-directories for loading / saving
           files. (Leave blank if files to be stored in main directory.)
        3. Tier names: Name of reference (default "syllable") and tonal tiers.
           Extra tiers can also be listed in "Other tiers to show".
        4. Pitch processing parameters: set minimum and maximum F0, and pitch
           smoothing parameter bandwidth for Praat Smooth function, which
           is performed on the pitch object before estimation of second
           time derivative of F0 (10 default: higher = less smoothing).
           If "Call detailed pitch parameter menu", is selected, the user
           will be presented with a more detailed menu before processing.
        5. Post idealisation smoothing parameters (moving point average)
           Smoothes the "ideal curve" to simulate the effects of physiological
           constraints on pitch movement (higher = more smoothing)
        6. Batch process directory: runs through whole directory and processes
           all files automatically. This assumes the user has already run the
           process manually. A figure options menu is opened before batch
           processing begins.

    D. RUNNING THE MAIN ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
        The Info window displays a reference guide.
        The following events occur for each textgrid and sound file pair in the
        directory.
        1. The first time a textgrid is opened, it is backed up.
        2. If a pitch object is not found, @fixPitch will be called. This
           first prompts the user to annotate a textgrid to show sections of
           the contour to be ignored due to gross segmental effects. It then
           creates a manipulation object in which the user can correct errors
           such as pitch doubling or pitch halving.
        4. The pitch contour is smoothed using the Praat Smooth function and
           points of maximum curvature are identified.
        3. The script draws a spectrogram of the sound object, the reference
           tier, and the pitch contour.
           The pitch contour is drawn using @c3Pogram, and shows F0 contour on
           the y-axis with the colour intensity and dot size indicating
           estimated Cepstral Peak Prominence at that time. (Red dots indicate
           CPP values more than one SD below the utterance mean.)
           The figure also can display other values derived from the script
           (see D.5.b.).
           NOTE: A legend is drawn before the image is saved but not earlier.
        4. The script will display the sound and textgrid for the current
           object. The textgrid displays only the reference, tonal, and maxK
           tiers, along with any tiers from the "Other tiers to show" option
           in the master menu. MaxK marks estimated locations of maximum
           curvature and their most likely tone type (H or L).

           THE USER SHOULD ANNOTATE THE TONAL TIER USING TIME POINTS INDICATED
           IN MAXK.

        5. A UI window will appear.
           NB: THE "PROCESS" BUTTON MUST BE SELECTED IN ORDER TO SAVE CHANGES!

           a. Change the smoothing parameters on the fly:
                1. Initial Praat smoothing bandwidth
                2. Physiological constraints
           b. Toggle the different display options on or off,
              i.e., corrected F0, F0 resynthesis, F0"(t), and tonal tier.
              The original C3Pogram image cannot be deselected.
           c. Add a "Comment" for the report file.
           d. Change the "Next object" value to jump to a different file
              in the directory.
           e. OBSERVATIONS AND ERRORS are shown if they appear.
              A beep alerts you to estimation errors of ideal targets.
           f. The option buttons allow the user to:
                1. "Smooth": re-smooth the contour using Praat smoothing
                   factor in the textbox. (Note: this will delete the
                   current MaxK and Tonal annotation tier)
                2. "Fix F0": run @FixPitch (see D.1. above)
                3. "Process": PROCESS, SAVE, AND REVIEW ANNOTATIONS
                   AND RESYNTHESIS
                4. "<": Go back one object without saving
                5. ">": Go to the "Next object" without saving
                6. "Exit": exit script (clears all temporary objects and
                    completes report)
                7. "Revert" and "Stop" are default Praat menu options

    E. OUTPUT
        1. main directory: updated TextGrids (if saved)
        2. image directory: [soundName].png
        3. pitch directory: updated pitch objects (if any)
        4. resynth directory: resynthesised pitch object and sound file
        5. manipulation directory:
            a. [soundName].Manipulation: resynthesised manipulation object
        6. output directory
            a. K-Max_Analysis_Report.txt: tab-separated file reporting
               latest smoothing parameters, tonal tier annotations and
               comments for each set of files
            b. K-MAX_form_parameters.txt: tab-separated file listing
               processing parameter settings from master UI form
            c. [soundName]_all_F0.Table: time (secs) and all F0 (Hz)
               contours: initial smoothed, ideal, and smoothed ideal
            d. [soundName]_ideal_TTs.Table: table showing time (secs)
               and F0 (Hz) coordinates of ideal tonal targets along
               with maxK annotations.
               NB: Slope re ST, Intercept ST re 100 Hz

    F. FAILSAFES / ERROR HANDLING
        1. Textgrid backup (backup folder);
        2. pitch boundaries are added to MaxK tier to show onset and offset of
           utterance voicing if no other nearby maxK values;
        3. When idealisation functions break down a warning beep sounds
           and the error is described in "WARNING AND OBSERVATIONS"
           at the bottom of the UI menu.

    G. KNOWN ISSUES
        1. The script will crash if the user does not correctly specify the
           name of the reference tier.
